# How to Contribute Your Capacitor Plugin to the Official Community

This guide explains how to create, publish, and share your Capacitor plugin so it can be recognized by the official Capacitor ecosystem and community.

## Step 1: Develop Your Plugin Following Best Practices

- Use the [official Capacitor plugin guidelines](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/plugins/creating-plugins) to build your plugin correctly.
- Support iOS, Android, and Web platforms if possible.
- Write clean, well-documented code.
- Include thorough README documentation with usage instructions, setup steps, and API references.
- Add tests for your plugin functionality.
- Use semantic versioning and follow npm publishing standards.

## Step 2: Publish Your Plugin on NPM

- Publish your plugin to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) under your own namespace.
- Use a clear and consistent package name, preferably prefixed with `@capacitor/` or related.
- Include a license file (usually MIT) and maintain an open source repo (e.g., on GitHub).

## Step 3: Share Your Plugin with the Capacitor Community

- Submit your plugin to the **Capacitor Community Plugins** organization if you want it maintained alongside other community plugins.  
  See: https://github.com/capacitor-community/plugins  
  You can open an issue or pull request proposing your plugin.

- Alternatively, maintain it under your own GitHub organization/repo and publicize it on forums.

## Step 4: Request Inclusion in the Official Capacitor Plugin List

- Capacitor maintains an official list of community plugins here:  
  https://capacitorjs.com/plugins/community

- To get your plugin listed there:  
  - Open an issue or submit a PR to the Capacitor documentation repo with your plugin details.  
  - Include plugin name, repo link, npm package link, supported platforms, and a short description.

## Step 5: Engage with the Community

- Announce your plugin on the official Capacitor [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Capacitor), forums, and social media.
- Encourage users to submit issues, feature requests, and contribute.
- Maintain your plugin actively by fixing bugs, updating for platform changes, and improving docs.

## Additional Tips
